# Tiny World

## Game Overview
Tiny World is a real-time strategy prototype with town-building and survival mechanics.

## Features

- Initializes with five humans.
- Randomly spawns bushes and trees, some with berries.
- Adds animals that can be hunted for food.
- Provides a central storage where humans can deposit or retrieve food and equipment.
- Hunger decreases over time; once empty health declines. Hungry humans look for food and can only eat items they carry or take from storage.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - main simulation page
- `js/main.js` - game logic
- `css/style.css` - visual styling

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a web browser to play with the simulation. All styles are stored in `css/style.css` and the game logic lives in `js/main.js`.
